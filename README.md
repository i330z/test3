# âš  DEPRECATED - NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE âš 
This boilerplate uses an older version of Nuxt and some now-unnecessary techniques, like loading content into a Vuex store. I recommend using [`@nuxt/content`](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) instead. Check out [the docs](https://content.nuxtjs.org/fetching) to see how loading content with `@nuxt/content` works. Once you have your website displaying content, use the [NetlifyCMS Docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/) to configure NetlifyCMS to allow you to edit that content.

I wanted to build a website with [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) but couldn't find any simple, well-documented templates that worked with the latest version of Nuxt, so I built my own! I hope you find it useful. ðŸ™‚

Many thanks to [Jake 101](https://jake101.com/), whose [Bael Template](https://github.com/jake-101/bael-template) served as a useful reference point as I built this.
